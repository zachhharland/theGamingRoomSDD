# theGamingRoomSDD
CS230 Project SDD for the Gaming Room application

Gaming Room client needed a highly scalable web application platform for their game. They want a game service based on the web implementing RESTful APIs.

I think I grasped the concept well and defined the parameters for the project effectively.

I found that getting outside of my personal experiences and asking developers in the space what common practices and industry standards were regarding the
application was a great way to challenge my understand of the project.

I would revise the reccomendations if I were to revise anything. There is so much more that can be offered and improved on in that section.

Trying to understand the customers needs has been a challenge throughout this project. I generally believe they want a webapp with the functionality and 
responsiveness of a native app and, I think, that's doable given the limited nature of the application. Without really understanding the customer's needs
it can be really difficult to plan for an architecture that meets their needs.

If I were to design the software for a project like this, I would consider a more web based approach rather than an application in the traditional sense.
